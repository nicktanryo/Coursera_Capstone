    "New York City is a multicultural place where different kinds of dishes can be found especially for western cuisine, and there seems to be a gap in the culinary industry where there might be a potential. Indonesian food is one of asian food that has not been marketed really well compare to other asian food such as japanese, korean, chinese, thai, etc. Starting a indonesian food restaurant can be a great start to market another type of asian food that might attract a certain group of people in New York, therefore openning the restaurant in a place where asian restaurants are available should give enough attention for the restaurant to grow, with the purpose of attracting existing asian cuisine lover to try out more of a similar delicacy.\n"
